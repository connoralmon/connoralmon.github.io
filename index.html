</div>
		<div>We first wanted to learn about craft beer and the culture around it. Many consider it a hobby with several parallels to music. While on demand delivery was not considered a major issue, we discovered many other opportunities that could be addressed.
</div>
		<div>Focusing on the discovery and selection of craft beers before purchase, we created a system for recording and rating beers to build a taste profile that provides accurate recommendations. Designing for mobile was necessary so it can be used while out.

		<div>C2C mobile commerce is a rapidly growing industry. As recent graduates, we recognized the opportunity of this type of service made specifically for college students and created Yazaar to do just that.

Leveraging Yik Yak’s brand recognition, geo-location technology, and focus on anonymity, we sought to develop a mobile app that would stand out from competitors on the market and fulfill the needs of our target users when both buying and selling used goods.

</div>
		<div>We wanted to address the problems gamers had with video game guides, specifically how to find them, and then make the upload portal to solve it. We prioritized the site navigation, with second screen usage and fitting the current interface as essential.
</div>
		<div>As the fourth largest source of peak internet traffic in the United States, Twitch has millions of viewers every month that come to watch live streams of video game content.

To increase customer engagement, we added a feature for users to upload pre-recorded game walkthroughs. Our primary challenge was to seamlessly integrate within Twitch’s website: maintaining the look and feel current visitors recognize, but new ones will be just as easily able to navigate.
